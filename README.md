## file structure represents a layered architecture, dividing the code into distinct layers based on their responsibilities

Here's a breakdown of the layers:

1. **Application Layer (`application`):** Focuses on orchestrating and coordinating the application's behavior. It includes controllers, services, and other components that implement the application's specific use cases.

2. **Domain Layer (`domain`):** Contains the core business logic and domain models. It represents the conceptual foundation of the application.

3. **Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure`):** Deals with external concerns, such as data providers, databases, or APIs. It provides implementations for the interfaces defined in the application layer.

4. **Presentation Layer (`presentation`):** Handles the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) aspects of the application. It includes screens, components, themes, and utilities related to the presentation of information.

Each layer has its own responsibilities and concerns
