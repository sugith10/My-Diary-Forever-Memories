# My Diary - Memories Forever

## Project Overview

This Flutter project follows a layered architecture, organizing code into distinct layers based on their responsibilities. This structure enhances maintainability, separation of concerns, and scalability.

## Layers Breakdown

1. **Application Layer (`application`):**
   - Orchestrates and coordinates the application's behavior.
   - Contains controllers, services, and components implementing specific use cases.

2. **Domain Layer (`core`):**
   - Houses core business logic and domain models.
   - Represents the conceptual foundation of the application.

3. **Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure`):**
   - Handles external concerns, such as data providers, databases, or APIs.
   - Provides implementations for interfaces defined in the application layer.

4. **Presentation Layer (`presentation`):**
   - Manages the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) aspects.
   - Includes screens, components, themes, and utilities related to presentation.

## Key Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer focuses on specific responsibilities, improving code organization and readability.
- **Maintainability:** The layered architecture enhances maintainability by isolating changes to specific layers.
- **Scalability:** The modular structure allows the project to scale by adding or modifying components within each layer.
